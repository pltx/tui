## Installation

Whilst being in early development, pltx-tui can only be manually installed via cargo.

**Linux**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pltx/tui
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

1. Run `pltx` to start the application.
2. You will see the dashboard. Press `}` twice to go two tabs to the right.
3. These are the help pages. Move up with **`j`** and down with **`k`**. Select "navigation" and press **`<enter>`**.
4. Here you'll find all the information you need to navigate pltx.

These pages are generated from the README files in the `/docs` directory, so you can also [view them on GitHub](https://github.com/pltx/tui/blob/main/docs).

Press **`[`** to go back and **`:`** to open the command prompt where you can type **`q`** + **`<enter>`** to quit (quit should auto-complete). You can also use the help command to go to the help pages from anywhere in the application.

## Modules

- **[Home](./docs/home.md):** Includes the dashboard, settings, and help pages.
- **[Project Management](./docs/project-management.md):** Manage project or general tasks. Similar to Trello or GitHub projects.
- **More coming soon!**
