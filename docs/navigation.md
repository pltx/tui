# Navigation

This page lists the general keybinds available mostly throughout the application.

Some keybinds, such as **`d`** (to delete) are only available when a selected option supports it. However, for all selected options that support it, **`d`** will always be the associated keybind. Likewise, keybinds here include "globally associated" keybinds.
